Nota: &#x60;disruption_active&#x3D;true&#x60; &lt;&#x3D;&gt; &#x60;data_freshness&#x3D;realtime&#x60; | [optional]
 **dataFreshness** | **String**| Define the freshness of data to use to compute journeys. When using the following parameter &#x60;&amp;data_freshness&#x3D;base_schedule&#x60; you can get disrupted journeys in the response. You can then display the disruption message to the traveler and make a &#x60;realtime&#x60; request to get a new undisrupted solution.  Possible values:  * &#39;base_schedule&#39; - Use theoric schedule information  * &#39;adapted_schedule&#39; - Use of adapted schedule information (like strike adjusting, etc.). Prefer &#x60;realtime&#x60; for traveler information as it will also contain adapted information schedule.  * &#39;realtime&#39; - Use all realtime information | [optional] [enum: base_schedule, adapted_schedule, realtime]
 **maxDuration** | **Integer**| Maximum duration of journeys in seconds (from &#x60;datetime&#x60; parameter). More usefull when computing an isochrone (only &#x60;from&#x60; or &#x60;to&#x60; is provided). On a classic journey (from-to), it will mostly speedup Navitia: You may have journeys a bit longer than that value (you would have to filter them). | [optional]
 **wheelchair** | **Boolean**| If true the traveler is considered to be using a wheelchair, thus only accessible public transport are used. Be warned: many data are currently too faint to provide acceptable answers with this parameter on. | [optional]
 **travelerType** | **String**| Define speeds and accessibility values for different kind of people. Each profile also automatically determines appropriate first and last section modes to the covered area. Note: this means that you might get car, bike, etc. fallback routes even if you set &#x60;forbidden_uris[]&#x60;! You can overload all parameters (especially speeds, distances, first and last modes) by setting all of them specifically. We advise that you don’t rely on the traveler_type’s fallback modes (&#x60;first_section_mode[]&#x60; and &#x60;last_section_mode[]&#x60;) and set them yourself. | [optional] [enum: cyclist, luggage, wheelchair, standard, motorist, fast_walker, slow_walker]
 **directPath** | **String**| Specify if direct path should be suggested | [optional] [default to indifferent] [enum: indifferent, only, none]
 **freeRadiusFrom** | **Integer**| Radius length (in meters) around the coordinates of departure in which the stop points are considered free to go (crowfly&#x3D;0) | [optional]
 **freeRadiusTo** | **Integer**| Radius length (in meters) around the coordinates of arrival in which the stop points are considered free to go (crowfly&#x3D;0) | [optional]
 **directPathMode** | [**List&lt;String&gt;**](String.md)| Force the direct-path modes.If this list is not empty, we only compute direct_path for modes in this listAnd filter all the direct_paths of modes in first_section_mode[] | [optional] [enum: taxi, walking, car, ridesharing, bss, bike]
 **resolution** | **Integer**| Sampling resolution | [optional] [default to 500]
